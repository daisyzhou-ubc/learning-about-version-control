Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

what I like most about version control: it keeps a history of all the works so I won't lose important stuffs.

what you find most challenging/confusing/frustrating about version control: collaborating with multiple people can make it hard to solve the merging conflict.
